# Case-management-System

We hope introduse a case management system for courts. The following project is made for that purpose. We used MySql for this project.

Functionalities

Add case details.
Add case current location.
Delete case file location.
Update case file location.
Search case information.

How to run the project :-

Import the database file in your MySql
Open the dbh.inc.php file and change the connection details as per your computer (If not done then it will not get connected to the database and thus the program will show an error).
Run the index.php file
Login id is "Admin" and password is "123".
